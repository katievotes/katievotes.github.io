Anoka County, Minnesota -- you're a population center, so there are lots of places to vote on election day (Nov. 3) and many "early" options from September 18 - Nov. 2.

Combing [Anoka county's election web site](https://www.anokacounty.us/3814/Voters){:target="_blank"}, it looks like all parts of Anoka County will have normal precinct-based polling places open on Nov. 3.

If you'd like to vote early, avoid falling into the registration "donut hole" and make sure you're registered by October 13.

## Early voting

1. [Please make sure you're registered to vote at the correct address](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/register-to-vote/){:target="_blank"} by October 13th.
	* See [info from the state at mnvotes.org](https://mnvotes.org){:target="_blank"} about registering _(or updating your registration)_ **online or by mail** by October 13, or for verifying that your registration is correct.
	* Visit the [Anoka County Government Center](https://www.anokacounty.us/3814/Voters){:target="_blank"} to register _(or update your registration)_ **in person** by October 13.
	* TBD:  whether you can register at [city halls serving as early voting centers](https://www.anokacounty.us/227/In-Person-Absentee-Voting){:target="_blank"}.  I presume so.
2. If you want to vote _**before**_ November 3, you'll need to **request** an "absentee" ballot.  As long as you're registered by October 13th, you can vote early by:
	* [requesting a ballot be mailed to you](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-by-mail/){:target="_blank"},
	* [picking up a ballot in person](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-in-person/){:target="blank"} at the [Anoka County Government Center](https://www.anokacounty.us/3814/Voters){:target="_blank"} or at [your city hall if it's serving as an early voting center](https://www.anokacounty.us/227/In-Person-Absentee-Voting){:target="_blank"}
3. Return your ballot [to Anoka County](https://www.anokacounty.us/3814/Voters){:target="_blank"} by:
	* mail _(presuming there's ample time for the postal service -- it needs to be postmarked by the 3rd and received by Anoka County by the 10th)_,
	* dropping it off at a dropbox at the Anoka County Government Center or your participating City Hall any time up through November 2

### Notes

* Did you know?  When you [vote early in-person](https://www.anokacounty.us/224/Vote-Early){:target="_blank"}, technically you're just combining the "in-person pickup" and "dropbox dropoff" options for "absentee" ballots within the course of a few minutes.
* Nov. 1 and don't have a car?  It's okay for someone else to take your "absentee" ballot to the County Government Center or your participating City Hall until Nov. 2, [as long as they haven't done it for too many other voters](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-by-mail/){:target="_blank"}, or as long as you're getting [agent delivery services](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-in-person/){:target="blank"}.

## "Oops" registration instructions

Did you wake up on October 20th, realize you're not actually registered properly, and wonder how you're going to vote?

You're in the "donut hole" between October 14th and November 2nd where you can't do anything about your registration for this election _(and, consequently, can't "vote early")_ -- but that doesn't mean you can't vote.  You just have to wait until November 3.

## Day-of instructions

Whether or not you registered by the 13th, your face-to-face "polling place" on November 3, where you can vote and where you can do [election-day registration](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/register-to-vote/register-on-election-day/){:target="_blank"}, is your **precinct polling place**.

**DO NOT** go to the Anoka County Government Center on November 3.  Go to your precinct polling place.

1. If you requested an absentee ballot, forgot about it until the morning of the 3rd, and decide to just go in and vote instead, that's fine.  Head on down to your polling place and vote.  Tear up your absentee ballot, use it for a grocery list, or teach your kids about elections with it.
2. If you mailed in your absentee ballot at the last miute, don't see it in the [state's verification system](https://mnvotes.sos.state.mn.us/AbsenteeBallotStatus.aspx){:target="_blank"}, are afraid it's not going to make it to the Anoka County Government Center by the 10th, and prefer to vote in person "just in case," that's fine.  Head down to the polling place and let them know what happened.  My understanding is that an in-person vote overrides any absentee vote received by the state _(I believe they discard your "absentee" ballot and send you notification telling you why -- which in this case would be that you voted in person on Election Day)_.
