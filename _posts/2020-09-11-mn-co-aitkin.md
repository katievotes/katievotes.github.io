Aitkin County, Minnesota -- thanks for kicking off the "how to vote in every county in Minnesota in 2020" series.  Nice to meet you.

Most of your townships have decided to rely upon mail-in voting, although a handful have decided to open a "precinct polling place" on November 3.

Visit [Aitkin county's election web site](https://www.co.aitkin.mn.us/departments/auditor/elections.html){:target="_blank"} and explore the links within to find out which kind of township you're in.

## If your township decided on pure "Mail Balloting"

### Voting instructions for early birds

1. [Make sure you're registered to vote at the correct address](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/register-to-vote/){:target="_blank"} by October 13th.
	* See [info from the state at mnvotes.org](https://mnvotes.org){:target="_blank"} about registering _(or updating your registration)_ **online or by mail** by October 13, or for verifying that your registration is correct.
	* Visit the [Aitkin County Government Center](https://www.co.aitkin.mn.us/departments/auditor/elections.html){:target="_blank"} to register _(or update your registration)_ **in person** by October 13.
2. Did you verify that you're registered correctly by October 13th?  No need to specially request an "absentee" (mail) ballot.  It will be mailed to you automatically because you live in a "mail balloting" township with a voter registration on file.
3. Return your ballot [to Aitkin County](https://www.co.aitkin.mn.us/departments/auditor/elections.html){:target="_blank"} by mail _(presuming there's ample time for the postal service -- it needs to be postmarked by the 2nd and received by Aitkin County by the 10th)_ or by dropping it off at a dropbox at the Aitkin County Government Center any time up through November 2.
	* Nov. 1 and don't have a car?  It's okay for someone else to take your "absentee" ballot to the County Government Center until Nov. 2, [as long as they haven't done it for too many other voters](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-by-mail/){:target="_blank"}, or as long as you're getting [agent delivery services](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-in-person/){:target="blank"}.

### "Oops" registration instructions

Oh no!  Did you wake up on October 20th, realize you're not actually registered properly in a "mail balloting" township, and wonder how you're going to vote?

You're in the "donut hole" between October 14th and November 2nd where you can't do anything about your registration for this election -- but that doesn't mean you can't vote.  You just have to wait until November 3.

Your face-to-face "polling place" on November 3, where you can do [election-day registration](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/register-to-vote/register-on-election-day/){:target="_blank"} and vote, is the [Aitkin County Government Center](https://www.co.aitkin.mn.us/departments/auditor/elections.html){:target="_blank"}.

That said, I spoke on the phone with your fantastic county auditor and they asked me to encourage people to register properly by October 13th, to avoid a crushing rush of people on the 3rd.

Your auditor's office staff are **really** nice, so please do them a favor in return and register by October 13th!

	* See [info from the state at mnvotes.org](https://mnvotes.org){:target="_blank"} about registering _(or updating your registration)_ **online or by mail** by October 13, or for verifying that your registration is correct.
	* Visit the [Aitkin County Government Center](https://www.co.aitkin.mn.us/departments/auditor/elections.html){:target="_blank"} to register _(or update your registration)_ **in person** by October 13.
2. If you want to vote _**before**_ November 3, you'll need to **request** an "absentee" ballot.
	* As long as you're registered by October 13th, you can vote early [by requesting a ballot be mailed to you](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-by-mail/){:target="_blank"} or [by picking up a ballot in person](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-in-person/){:target="blank"} at the [Aitkin County Government Center](https://www.co.aitkin.mn.us/departments/auditor/elections.html){:target="_blank"}.
3. Return your ballot [to Aitkin County](https://www.co.aitkin.mn.us/departments/auditor/elections.html){:target="_blank"} by mail _(presuming there's ample time for the postal service -- it needs to be postmarked by the 3rd and received by Aitkin County by the 10th)_ or by dropping it off at a dropbox at the Aitkin County Government Center any time up through November 2 _(or, if you picked it up in person and want to turn it in right away, by ... filling it out on-site and dropping it wherever you're instructed)_.
	* Nov. 1 and don't have a car?  It's okay for someone else to take your "absentee" ballot to the County Government Center until Nov. 2, [as long as they haven't done it for too many other voters](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-by-mail/){:target="_blank"}, or as long as you're getting [agent delivery services](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/other-ways-to-vote/vote-early-in-person/){:target="blank"}.

### "Oops" registration instructions

Did you wake up on October 20th, realize you're not actually registered properly in a "precinct polling place" township, and wonder how you're going to vote?

You're in the "donut hole" between October 14th and November 2nd where you can't do anything about your registration for this election _(and, consequently, can't "vote early")_ -- but that doesn't mean you can't vote.  You just have to wait until November 3.

### Day-of instructions

Whether or not you registered by the 13th, your face-to-face "polling place" on November 3, where you can vote and where you can do [election-day registration](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/register-to-vote/register-on-election-day/){:target="_blank"}, is your **precinct polling place**.

**DO NOT** go to the Aitkin County Government Center on November 3 if you live in a township with precinct-based election-day voting.  Go to your precinct polling place.

1. If you requested an absentee ballot, forgot about it until the morning of the 3rd, and decide to just go in and vote instead, that's fine.  Head on down to your polling place and vote.  Tear up your absentee ballot, use it for a grocery list, or teach your kids about elections with it.
2. If you mailed in your absentee ballot at the last miute, don't see it in the [state's verification system](https://mnvotes.sos.state.mn.us/AbsenteeBallotStatus.aspx){:target="_blank"}, are afraid it's not going to make it to the Aitkin County Government Center by the 10th, and prefer to vote in person "just in case," that's fine.  Head down to the polling place and let them know what happened.  My understanding is that an in-person vote overrides any absentee vote received by the state _(I believe they discard your "absentee" ballot and send you notification telling you why -- which in this case would be that you voted in person on Election Day)_.
